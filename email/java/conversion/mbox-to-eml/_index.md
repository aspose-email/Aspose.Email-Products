        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="MBOX" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/email/mbox/" >}}

MBox file format is a generic term that represents a container for collection of electronic mail messages. The messages are stored inside the container along with their attachments. Messages from an entire folder are saved in a single database file and new messages are appended to the end of the file. Numerous applications and API provide support for MBox file format such as Apple Mail and Mozilla Thunderbird.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="EML" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/email/eml/" >}}

EML file format represents email messages saved using Outlook and other relevant applications. Almost all emailing clients support this file format for its compliance with RFC-822 Internet Message Format Standard. Microsoft Outlook is the default software for opening EML message types. EML files can be used for saving to disc as well as sending out to recipients using communication protocols.
